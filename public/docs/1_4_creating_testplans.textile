In the response times by label chart you will get a visual representation of errors with small dots above the time line. If configured in your test plan these will show a snapshot of the response from the server for the request in error.

To "snapshot on error" simply add a listener "Save Responses to a file" with the filename prefix as follows:
<pre>
public/uploads/${__log(snapshot_${__escapeHtml(${__samplerName()})}_${testguid}_${__counter(FALSE,)},ERR)}
</pre>

You will also need to tick the following defaults for the listener:
