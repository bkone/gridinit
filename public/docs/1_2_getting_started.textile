h1. Getting Started

h2. !../images/icon/dashboard.png! Dashboard

Everything starts with the dashboard. The dashboard gives you access to things like test results, recent tests and grid node management.

h3. !../images/icon/recent_tests.png! Recent Tests

!../images/1_2_recent_tests.png! 

Recent Tests gives you a quick overview of the last 5 tests, including their Apdex score, privacy status, targeted domain and run date. Use the drop down menu to manage, start, abort or delete test results.

h3. !../images/icon/grid_nodes.png! Grid Nodes

!../images/1_2_grid_nodes.png! 

Grid Nodes shows you which grid nodes are connected including last known status in terms of CPU, services running and current role. Use the drop down menu to restart or launch additional grid nodes.

h2. !../images/icon/new_test.png! New Tests

Click on the !../images/icon/new_test.png! *New Test* link to get started. From here you can execute basic or advanced test plans.

h3. Basic Test

!../images/1_2_basic_test.png! 

A basic test will execute load against a target URL. Frome here you can specify the URL, target number of threads (concurrent users), rampup time (in seconds) and duration (in seconds). Casual use of gridinit.com will limit you to 50 threads per grid node, and 60 seconds each for rampup and duration time. The basic test will execute your parameters against a pre-defined JMeter template which you can "download from here":https://raw.github.com/altentee/gridinit/master/config/jmeter

This template introduces conservative settings such as a gaussian random time between 5 - 10 seconds (think time) and 1 - 5 seconds (pacing) between each iteration. The script will also stop automatically if average response time is greater than 10 seconds or the error rate is greater than 50 failed transactions. This prevents the basic test from a becoming denial of service type test. 

h3. Advanced Test

!../images/1_2_advanced_test.png!

An advanced test will execute load from a user provider JMeter test plan which you must upload. Similar parameters for threads, rampup, duration and host can be overridden with user provided parameters. These parameters will override relevant JMeter property functions if defined in your test plan. This lets you create _generic_ testplan templates which you can modify at run time with different parameters.

A JMeter property can be defined like this:

<pre>
${__P(duration,60)}
</pre>

Where "duration" is the property name, and 60 is the default value if not defined. Setting the "duration" property from Gridinit will override any occurrences of this in the test plan.

This is a simplified property function which is intended for use with properties defined on the command line. Unlike the __property function, there is no option to save the value in a variable, and if no default value is supplied, it is assumed to be 1. The value of 1 was chosen because it is valid for common test variables such as loops, thread count, ramp up etc.

h3. Selecting Grid Nodes

!../images/1_2_select_grid_nodes.png!

Both the Basic and Advanced test plan will ask you to select grid nodes which you would like to distribute your test to. Slave nodes are automatically selected. Master nodes cannot be selected as these are reserved for the relatively expensive operations of indexing and presenting results data in real time. Choose which nodes you want to distribute to and click the *Start Test* button. 

_Note: If you are not signed in you will not be able to execute any tests._
