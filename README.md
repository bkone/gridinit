## What is the Grid?

The grid is a collection of performance test automation tools deployed on cloud resources, making them an inexpensive and disposable test asset for a wide variety of testing needs. 

Here at [Altentee](http://altentee.com/), we rely on the use of open source tools such as [JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org), [Watir-Webdriver](http://watirwebdriver.com), [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and [Logstash](http://logstash.net/).
